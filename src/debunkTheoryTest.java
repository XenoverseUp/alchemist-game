1-Requirements for debunkTheory:

The successful execution of debunkTheory requires the proper initialization and 
correct state of the following components: alchemyMarkerDeck, publicationCardDeck and auth, which must 
be initialized and in a state where functions such as getCurrentPlayer(), increaseReputation(), 
and removeGoldFromCurrentUser() can be utilized.

2-Modifications by debunkTheory:

Upon meeting the specified requirements, debunkTheory introduces several modifications. 
It impacts the player's reputation by increasing the reputation of the 
current player by 2 (as per specifications). 
The alchemy marker association is altered, causing the selected alchemy marker to dissociate. 
Furthermore, the selected publication card in the publishing card deck undergoes a 
modification as an alchemy marker is removed, and it is no longer linked to the current player. 
The GUI state is adjusted based on these conditions.

3-Effects of debunkTheory:

a) Successful Debunk:
When the specified requirements are fulfilled, indicating a successful debunk, 
debunkTheory results in an increase in the player's reputation by 2 and 
decrase in published theory's owner's reputation by 2. 
The selected alchemy marker dissociates, and the linked publication card is altered to remove the association. 
Then the correct alchemy marker is attached.
A graphical user interface dialog box is presented to the player, 
confirming the successful debunking of the theory. 

b) Unsuccessful Debunk:
When the specified requirements are fulfilled, but the published theory was already correct, 
debunkTheory results in an decrease in the player's reputation by 1.
Nothing happens to the selected alchemy marker.
A graphical user interface dialog box is presented to the player, 
confirming the unsuccessful debunking of the theory. 

c) No Changes (Conditions Not Met):
If the original requirements are not met, debunkTheory ensures that no modifications are made to the 
player's gold, reputation, or any condition of the deck.
