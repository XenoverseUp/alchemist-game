The final project of COMP302 course written in Java, using Swing.

## Instructions
- To clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/comp-302-group-1/alchemist-game</code>
- To checkout to a branch: <code>git checkout {branch-name}</code>
- To open a new branch: <code>git branch {branch-name}</code>
- Branch only on **development** branch and merge back to it.
- Open pull request to merge your branch and never merge before code review.
- **Never** directly commit to the main branch as we will merge development into it only on deployment.

## How to push your code?
After cloning the repo first time, make sure your branch is development (<code>git checkout development</code>). On development branch, open a new branch based on your code (<code>git branch {branch-task-name}</code>) and checkout to it (<code>git checkout {branch-task-name}</code>). Make your development, commit and push your code using following commands:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "commit-message"
3. git push -u origin branch-task-name
